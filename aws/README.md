Some things for doing some things with AWS.

It's up to you to deal with things like your AWS credentials. I'm assuming that if you've somehow found this, then you're smart enough to have the appropriate things installed, have your credentials set up correctly, and won't come crying to me for tech-support ;-)

Careful where you tread, here be dragons, my shoddy scripts and one-liners might delete your entire infrastructure, I am not to be held responsible, etc etc.
